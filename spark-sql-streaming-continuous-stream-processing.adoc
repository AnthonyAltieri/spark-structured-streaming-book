== Continuous Stream Processing (Structured Streaming V2)

*Continuous Stream Processing* is a new stream processing model in Spark Structured Streaming (often referred as *Structured Streaming V2*) that is used for <<spark-sql-streaming-Trigger.adoc#Continuous, Trigger.Continuous>> trigger.

Continuous stream processing uses <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#, ContinuousExecution>> as the stream execution engine.
