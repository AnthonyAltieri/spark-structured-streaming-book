== [[ContinuousReadSupport]] ContinuousReadSupport Contract -- Data Sources with ContinuousReaders

`ContinuousReadSupport` is the <<contract, abstraction>> of <<implementations, data sources>> with a <<createContinuousReader, ContinuousReader>>.

[[contract]]
[[createContinuousReader]]
`ContinuousReadSupport` defines a single `createContinuousReader` method that creates a <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousReader.adoc#, ContinuousReader>>.

[source, java]
----
ContinuousReader createContinuousReader(
  Optional<StructType> schema,
  String checkpointLocation,
  DataSourceOptions options)
----

`createContinuousReader` is used when:

* `ContinuousExecution` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#runContinuous, run a streaming query>> (and finds <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecutionRelation.adoc#, ContinuousExecutionRelations>> in the <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#logicalPlan, analyzed logical plan>>)

* `DataStreamReader` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-DataStreamReader.adoc#load, create a streaming query for a ContinuousReadSupport data source>>
