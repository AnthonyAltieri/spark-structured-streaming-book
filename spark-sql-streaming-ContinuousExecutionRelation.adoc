`ContinuousExecutionRelation` is a `MultiInstanceRelation` and leaf logical operator.

NOTE: Read up on leaf logical operator in Mastering Spark SQL gitbook.

`ContinuousExecutionRelation` is <<creating-instance, created>> when `ContinuousExecution` is <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#, created>> (and requested for the <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#logicalPlan, logical plan>> with <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamingRelationV2.adoc#, StreamingRelationV2>> operators with <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousReadSupport.adoc#, ContinuousReadSupport>> sources).

`ContinuousExecutionRelation` takes the following when created:

* [[source]] <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousReadSupport.adoc#, ContinuousReadSupport source>>
* [[extraOptions]] Options (`Map[String, String]`)
* [[output]] Output attributes (`Seq[Attribute]`)
